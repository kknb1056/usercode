This CVS directory contains code for Mark Grimes' work. Email mark.grimes@bristol.ac.uk or mark.grimes@cern.ch if you have any questions. The current directories are:

--------------------
- VHbbAnalysisCode -
--------------------

Contains code for the tracker Phase1 upgrade VHbb analysis. This should be checked out into a directory called "TrkUpgradeAnalysis/VHbb" for the correct file hierarchy. For example, this should work:
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
cvs co -D 2012-02-14 -d TrkUpgradeAnalysis/VHbb UserCode/grimes/VHbbAnalysisCode
scram b

---------------------
- TrackingTruthCode -
---------------------

Changes to the digitisation producers and TrackingTruthProducer to get them to work with the new mixing setup. The mixing module has been changed to load up pileup events one at a time instead of all at once, which necessitates fixing some code. I don't have write permission for the specific CMSSW packages so I'm putting the changes in here for the time being.
This should get things working
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
cvs co -d SimGeneral/TrackingAnalysis UserCode/grimes/TrackingTruthCode/SimGeneral/TrackingAnalysis
cvs co -d SimTracker/SiStripDigitizer UserCode/grimes/TrackingTruthCode/SimTracker/SiStripDigitizer
scram b

----------
- L1Menu -
----------

Refactoring of the L1 Trigger rate estimation and menu generation code.
